text based setup -> start game screen
	num players, board size, num white units, white unit spacing, scoring rules
	terrain -> seasons
zoom
	click white unit (also for spawning?)
scoring
	connections
		check only ground level?
	connecting white units
	harvesting, store in white units
	manual editing
	influence, check if surrounded
	many kinds of points
		surrounded by G and B -> GB points
		doubly surrounded -> ? maybe filter out rgb from RGB, Rgb->Rb->R or Rrb->Rb->R
		top/bottom surrounded
		white helps
	R eats from G who eats from B who eats from R
	R emits r
	surrounded points in a layer
units
	free unit that generates 1 point per turn from where it is placed
	units that can jump from where it is spawned
	cost rules, arbitrary harvesting, up(down)grading
	combine colored points to harvest multiple colors
	movable units, programmable
	tunnel/bridge units, 3/9 times cost?
	solar harvester
		made from G harvests green points, upgrade with RB
database
	changes
	location
		terrain, units, misc
		type Loc?


How about letting players move simultaneously and let their moves be in superpositions? Either resolved randomly where players may lay extra potential moves or by playing another game on the contested location.
Keep count on how many times each player has begun. No official komi, no official winner
Material is created with shapes they are surrounded to
Units emit pointgas so balance in colored units provide optimal gaspoints
type Game, save(game)
make borders on units so white doesnt disappear

Why doesnt in work for keys?
